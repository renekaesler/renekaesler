  Modula&shy;rity, object orien&shy;tation, <abbr title="Dont Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr> & 
  <abbr title="Keep It Simple, Stupid">KISS</abbr> are the most used terms when you ask about clean 
  coding. However, the points modula&shy;rity and <i>DRY</i> already do not harmo&shy;nize very
  well. When you are coding in a modular fashion, you automa&shy;tically will have code
  dupli&shy;cations to avoid side effects between indi&shy;vidual modules. Also object 
  orien&shy;tation is not an absolute solution. In extreme cases, inher&shy;itance has been misused
  to store recurring code fragments in an abstract base class. Nowadays the code is <i>DRY</i>, 
  without any trace of modula&shy;rity & KISS anymore!

<p>
  Started with C++ program&shy;ming, I have been designing appli&shy;cations based on the latest 
  interface & web techno&shy;logies since 2015. I am always focused on the sustain&shy;ability of
  the software. By using alter&shy;native paradigms, such as aspect oriented & func&shy;tional
  program&shy;ming, I am able to master the balancing act between <i>DRY</i> and modula&shy;rity. 
  With careful archi&shy;tecture planning, even perfor&shy;mance critical appli&shy;cations are not
  a problem for me.

<p>
  Modula&shy;rity, object orien&shy;tation & <i>DRY</i> are important for sustain&shy;able software
  devel&shy;opment. However, it is really important to strike the balance here. Therefore, one term
  inspires me the most:
